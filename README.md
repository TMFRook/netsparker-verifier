# netsparker-verifier

Containerizing the Netsparker verifier.

# Running

1. Add your API_TOKEN to appsettings.json file.
2. Run `./build.sh`.
3. Run `docker run -ti netsparker-verifier-agent`

# Issues

The app seems to launch fine, but I never see the verifier register on Netsparker's Agent dashboard.
